(reporter) colonel, our country will have a new president in a few days. the fmln has called a new transportation stoppage beginning on 31 may and has now attacked the 1st brigade.  based on this evidence, do you feel the fmln will intensify its military actions in san salvador?      (military officer) of course, we are expecting this.  channel 12 has already reported that a transportation stoppage will begin on 31 may. therefore, we believe vigilance must be increased.  we expected this kind of attack.  we have always said we are prepared to repel any terrorist attack, and this was a typical terrorist attack.  from a military standpoint, i do not think the attack was very effective.  the guerrillas used mortars but mostly hurt civilians.

broadcasts a 1 hour and 11 minute live or recorded speech \"to the nation\" by salvadoran president alfredo cristiani on \"the current situation in the country and the national recovery plan.\"  no date or place is given.    cristiani begins by saying that this is his first report to the nation after 50 days as president.  he notes that since he assumed power on 1 june, the farabundo marti national liberation front has increased its level of violence and its number of \"indiscriminate killings.\"  he says that there is no reason for this since he expressed on 1 june his desire find a peaceful solution to the conflict in the country.    cristiani says that since 1 june he has repeatedly called for a peace dialogue, adding:  \"in order to begin a dialogue of this nature, it must be held in two phases:  naturally, during the first phase both sides must sit down to discuss the mechanisms to develop that dialogue process, a timetable for the talks, and the place where the talks will be held.  in other words, the first phase will be to determine how the dialogue process will take place.  the second phase -- once an agreement is reached on how the dialogue will be held -- is what will be discussed.  in that regard, our government has not set any conditions.  we are willing to discuss any topic, because we know that we must find solutions to many things, and we are willing to do so.  the only condition we have demanded for this dialogue process is that, once it begins, it should not be interrupted for any reason.  we believe that people want peace as soon as possible, and we cannot hold talks for years.  once we sit down to talk, that dialogue should continue until an overall solution is found to the conflict.  that is our government's position, and we maintain that position because we believe it is the most logical one.\"    turning to economic matters, cristiani says that the country needs to solve three problems:  the fiscal deficit, inflation, and unemployment.  he says that as a first step to begin the national economic recovery is to reform the government's pricing policy, adding:  \"we must protect low-income groups, and for this reason we have asked the economy minister to begin a process aimed at eliminating price controls.  we believe that we can eliminate price controls on 230 products without having a major impact on the majority of the public and that we can keep staple products under the control of the economy ministry.\"  he says that price controls on staples like basic grains, powdered milk, flour, coffee, sugar, vegetable oil and lard, cement for housing, and oil by-products will not be eliminated.    regarding the transportation sector, cristiani says: \"we agreed with the transportation sector to deregulate the differential service. to allow them to continue serving low-income segments of the population while charging current fares, we will also allow them to offer the higher-priced service.  in other words, people will be able to choose what kind of service they want to use: whether they continue to use the low-priced service or a better, more comfortable, and faster service.\"    on electricity rates, cristiani says: \"we feel that adjustments to electricity rates should be applied as a result of power that is wasted, that is, because it is power that is being consumed beyond what is needed to live normally.  the increase in electricity rates will be directly proportional to the consumption of energy in each home.  we believe that with this initial measure, the cel (lempa river hydroelectric executive commission) solve problems.\"    turning to other economic measures, cristiani says:  \"we have to take short-term measures too.  in this respect, the most logical step is to take measures that will affect consumption and not revenues. thus, we have asked the finance minister to take measures related to taxes.  he is to consolidate tax payments and only exempt the previously mentioned basic bread basket items from the present 5-percent tax.  we have to start eliminating tax exemptions.  only exports should have some type of monetary incentive because our country is interested in developing its exports.  the rest of the country's economic sectors should be taxed at the same rate.\"    cristiani adds:  \"we are going to modify the system of paying income tax.  we believe that the current system is based on unjust regulations, on revenues earned the previous year that do not reflect a firm's present situation.  thus, we are going to request that income-tax payments be based on a small percentage of the firm's present sales; these are a truer and more accurate reflection of a firm's income.\"    cristiani says that the country's monetary policy must be aimed at increasing savings to promote domestic economic development.  he says that it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the country's banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country. regarding the country's currency, cristiani says:  \"we feel that currency value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign exchange.  we do not think it is appropriate for the government to arbitrarily devalue and fix an exchange rate on the salvadoran colon. everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to pay out for imports, because if we were to fix the rate at 10 (colones) to 1 (dollar), the central banks still would not have enough foreign exchange to cover all the importers' demands.\"    further

(larco cox) the country that grants asylum determines this.  we have been very careful to review each one of them and their files.  we have checked to see if any of them were facing any trials in panama or the united states.  our investigation has revealed that none of them are facing any trials.  the charges were made afterward.  we see this as a result of the emotional climate presently existing in panama.    (reporter) what is your personal opinion of the incident?    (larco cox) it is the diplomatic way to express a protest over what they have been led to believe.  according to panamanian reports, charge d'affaires luis sandiga has made statements on the situation that did not please the government.  the truth is that sandiga has not made any declarations.  however, former ambassador castro arenas is in panama and he has embarked on a campaign in which he is seeking retaliation against the peruvian government.  he could not think of anything better than to point at sandiga as the person responsible for alleged statements.  sandiga has not said a word about the situation because that is not his job.  besides, his car and the car belonging to one of the embassy's military attaches have been stolen; there is no way to begin an investigation.    (reporter) are you saying that former ambassador castro arenas is directly responsible for the situation?    (larco cox) you can make your own conclusions.

(larco cox) the country that grants asylum determines this.  we have been very careful to review each one of them and their files.  we have checked to see if any of them were facing any trials in panama or the united states.  our investigation has revealed that none of them are facing any trials.  the charges were made afterward.  we see this as a result of the emotional climate presently existing in panama.    (reporter) what is your personal opinion of the incident?    (larco cox) it is the diplomatic way to express a protest over what they have been led to believe.  according to panamanian reports, charge d'affaires luis sandiga has made statements on the situation that did not please the government.  the truth is that sandiga has not made any declarations.  however, former ambassador castro arenas is in panama and he has embarked on a campaign in which he is seeking retaliation against the peruvian government.  he could not think of anything better than to point at sandiga as the person responsible for alleged statements.  sandiga has not said a word about the situation because that is not his job.  besides, his car and the car belonging to one of the embassy's military attaches have been stolen; there is no way to begin an investigation.    (reporter) are you saying that former ambassador castro arenas is directly responsible for the situation?    (larco cox) you can make your own conclusions.    (reporter) if the situation deteriorates, will peru recall all of its personnel from panama?    (larco cox) we cannot go to that extreme because we are fulfilling a humanitarian cause, as we said in the communique.  our first responsibility at this time is to see that the right of asylum is respected.  as long as the refugees remain in the embassy, we will maintain our representation at the level of first secretary.

an end to the repressive regime imposed by the sandinists,\" said the chief of staff of the nicaraguan resistance (rn).    this past january, the 29-year-old galeano became the leader of about 12,000 nicaraguan rightist rebels based in honduras when the post of commander in chief of the rn army, a post enrique bermudez had held for 10 years, was eliminated.    nicaragua will hold elections on sunday, 25 february, and the main candidates running for president are daniel ortega of the sandinist national liberation front (fsln) and violeta de chamorro of the uno.    the rebels, supported by the united states, have urged nicaraguans to vote for the uno candidate.    \"if the uno wins, we will maintain our organization intact to see if on 25 april there is a total transfer of power and profound reforms, and particularly to see if the repressive system disappears,\" galeano said.    \"if the sandinists win or steal the elections, there will be a social disruption against the system and the hardest struggle of recent years will take place,\" he added.    the contra military chief said that \"if the people do not accept a sandinist victory, \"we will have to continue fighting.\"    he assured that the nicaraguans will not accept an fsln victory in the 25 february elections.    galeano added that the sandinists have deployed approximately 30,000 troops in the northern nicaraguan departments in order to \"intimidate and murder\" uno followers and to prevent approximately 300,000 nicaraguans from voting.    galeano pointed out that the press and the foreign observers of the elections have no access to the areas where the nicaraguan troops have deployed.    \"even though the foreign observers claim that the campaign was freely held, the people have had to make sacrifices,\" he said.    galeano said that about 5,000 of his men are inside nicaragua, and between 10,000 to 12,000 men are in bases in honduras, \"not moving, but just observing the electoral process\" in nicaragua.    the rebels in honduras are receiving u.s. humanitarian aid in el paraiso department and have rejected a demobilization plan approved by the central american presidents.  the rebels claim they do not have any guarantees for their personal security and for the implementation of a democratic process.    \"the demobilization is based on the nicaraguan government creating conditions that will encourage the members of the armed rn to join civic life,\" he added.    galeano said that the dismantling of his forces does not \"depend of a simple elections,\" but rather on \"the sandinists leaving power completely.\"    the contra leader warned that \"we cannot lay down our weapons when the causes that led to our taking up arms have not disappeared.  there still is repression, a lack of freedom, and all of this was generated by the sandinists.\"    he pointed out that in the event the uno should win the 25 february elections, \"we would have to carry out a mutual demobilization.  the nicaraguan problem can be solved with an inter-american peace force that will receive all the weaponry and soviet tanks of the sandinists. then, when we are at an even level of forces, we will turn over our own weapons.\"    the contra chief suggested a national police be created in nicaragua.    franklin said that the contras are willing to continue the peace

prepared to face a rupture of diplomatic relations with mexico and peru to enforce the law, foreign minister dr. julio e. linares asserted when referring to former collaborators of former general

national bank of panama.  however, the panamanian authorities have confirmed that they would not grant him a safeconduct to leave the country, and they sent a note to the mexican embassy urging it to desist from offering him protection.    according to the public prosecutor's office, rafael arosemena is involved in authorizing the payment of checks for $12 million, made out to cash by former colonel marcos justines.  meanwhile, heraclides sucre and gonzalo gonzalez, former majors in the now defunct defense forces, have sought asylum at the peruvian embassy in panama city. they are accused of killing major moises giroldi, who led the foiled coup d'etat against noriega in october 1989.    \"we are willing to pay whatever price is necessary to enforce the law, because these political refugees are common criminals and they have no right to that benefit,\" linares stated when asked by critica libre if panama would be willing to stop the people who have sought asylum at the mexican and peruvian embassies from leaving the country without facing a trial for the crimes they reportedly perpetrated during the previous regime.    linares said that panama will maintain its position of not granting safe-conducts to these refugees, even if the mexican and peruvian government insist on granting them diplomatic asylum, and admitted that this will likely create an international conflict.    nevertheless, linares said that he hopes there will be no need to break diplomatic relations with either of these countries, which insist on keeping former collaborators of former gen noriega as refugees, and he emphasized the need to reach an understanding with these nations.    \"we hope that relations with mexico will not cool off or reach a breaking point given the affection that unites us as free nations,\" linares added.    he revealed that the peruvian embassy sent a note to the panamanian government stating that it will continue to give diplomati protection to the

casualties.    radio farabundo marti has also reported that the guerrila forces caused 28 army casualties in clashes on 2 may in la laguna, chalatenango department, located approximately 90 km north

undertaken with the mediation of un secretary general javier perez de cuellar.    perez de cuellar's special envoy, alvaro de soto, arrived in san salvador on 2 may as part of the negotiations.  he met with president alfredo cristiani and the national dialogue commission today, and later he will meet with other leaders.    guillermo ungo, secretary general of the social democratic national

difficult times. powerful forces are trying to justify violence and war every time diplomatic channels or commitments are not followed or met.    when there is an armed struggle and when thousands are killed on the battlefield, those who promote violence never conclude from those useless killings that war is futile. they do not believe that peace can be achieved through dialogue and negotiation.    it will always be easier to rectify mistakes when the weaknesses are political or when errors are made on the road to peace. we cannot bring the dead back to life, and violence born of hatred takes a long time to heal.    i believe, mr president, that it would be encouraging if you were to rectify some political decisions your government made following the unfortunate incidents at nandaime.  it is important to reopen the communications media that are closed. it is necessary to release the prisoners and to revoke the sentences imposed upon them as punishment for involvement in those incidents.  the peace plan to which we are committed obliges us to restore confidence as soon as possible. our most sacred commitment is to continue progressing on the path toward democratization.    it is imperative that your government and the nicaraguan contras resume negotiations to secure a permanent end to military actions in nicaragua. this could very well be an encouraging example for many central american and other countries. i offer you our costa rican territory for the resumption of such negotiations. i also offer you all the assistance within my means to enable such negotiations to take place.    i understand that you will attend the upcoming inaugural ceremony in ecuador. i believe it would be a sign of confidence in the future of peace, a noble gesture toward rodrigo borja, and would aid in strengthening the ecuadoran democratic process if you attended the ceremony in quito after reversing the setbacks incurred as a result of antidemocratic actions, such as penalizing the communications media and depriving men and women of their liberty.    only if we have the strength to correct our mistakes and the vision to continue on the path outlined in the peace plan can central americans prevent the continuance of the armed aggression against our peoples. a latin american commitment to peace also requires efforts to achieve independence and democracy. we will not be

southern colombia.    it added that nine guerrillas of the army of national liberation were killed in clashes with troops of the 4th infantry brigade on the border of antioquia and choco departments and that six farc rebels were killed in caqueta department.    suspected guerrillas dynamited at dusk a bridge in bogota's urban center, injuring six people. the bridge did not sustain major damage.

(leyva) the truth is that i proposed something to the government, the political parties, and the guerrillas.  what you call talks is nothing more than the guerrillas' reply to the proposal--the same way as (former president) dr turbay, social conservative party president dr fabio valencia, and dr jaramillo ossa of the patriotic union did. the cardinals have been informed of the proposal, and the m-19 and farc have replied. in fact, they went even further; they unilaterally ended hostilities.  now the ball is in the government's court.    (gracia) taking into account that after agreeing not to, for example, carry out any ambushes against troops, the guerrillas continued; they broke the agreement. do you think we can again trust these statements?    (leyva) i cannot measure the confidence that should be given to others. the only thing i know is the government is seeking peace, so i imagine this is precisely the way. the suspicion that the government might have of them is the same as you might have, but if the government seeks peace, here is where they can find it, with a preliminary end to hostilities on all fronts. this is what (farc general secretary) jacobo arenas wrote in a letter that was not addressed to me but to the former presidents of colombia.

combing the area in search of guerrillas when it was ambushed on 22 november, the newspaper expreso reported today.    the wave of violence has hit peruvian tourist establishments in the city of huaraz, capital of the ancash department, where four inns and hotels were bombed last night, damaging the buildings and injuring an 18 year-old girl.    in cusco, 1,000 km southeast of lima, a bus (as received) heading toward machu pichu went out of control as the result of sabotage and fell into a 60-meter ravine. the wives of the jersey city, united states, and cusco mayors died in this accident.    leftist senator enrique bernales ballesteros, president of the special commission for the investigation and study of terrorism and violence, has noted that the escalation of violence has claimed the lives of 21 people per day during the month of november. he said that the increased violence can be traced to actions by the terrorist groups shining path and tupac amaru revolutionary movement (mrta). these attacks were repressed by the forces of order.    senator bernales reported that 630 people were killed in violent acts in november and that 1,775 have been killed over the past 12 months.    bernales said that 403 people were killed in november as a result of violent acts, including 147 civilians, 165 presumed terrorists, 65 armed forces members, and 26 drug traffickers. a total of 227 people were killed in urban violent acts.    senator bernales added that a total of nearly 13,000 people have been killed since the terrorist violence began in 1980.    bernales expressed his concern over the fact that 67 percent of the people killed in violent acts involved youths who were between 15 and 29 years of age. he asked the government to establish guidelines to counter this social phenomenon.    amid this bloody and destructive situation, the peruvian episcopal conference has made a christmas appeal, asking that--without ignoring \"the seriousness of the situation\"--for a truce \"for peace, reconciliation, and tranquillity\" to prevail in the country.    the bishops said: \"recalling he who prevailed over death, we call upon those who have resorted to violence and

emergence of former prime minister luis alva castro as new party leader.    the apra congress eliminated the post of party president, which was created for alan garcia in 1985, consolidating his position as party leader following a decisive victory in the presidential election of that year.    according to some critics within the party, the personalism that had characterized garcia's undisputed leadership since 1982 was thus ended.    luis alva castro, 46, former prime minister and economy minister as well as former president of the chamber of deputies, was elected by a large margin as the new secretary general, a post which regained the highest status in the party. alva castro capitalized on the internal dissidence and on the party's disenchantment with alan garcia as a result of the deterioration of the social and economic situation, which is considered the worst crisis in this century and is blamed on the chief of state's \"stubbornness\" in not changing his nationalistic and populist policy line.\"    the new cadre elected at the 16th apra congress is in favor of a \"change in orientation\" in the party's management and in the public administration for the remaining 18 months of the apra's term in office. it is expected that alan garcia and alva castro may reach an agreement on the way the government should be run until 1990, when the current presidential term will end following new general elections.    garcia also lost the presidency of the political commission that sets the party's political line. this post was won by luis alberto sanchez, 88, first vice president of the nation and one of the mainsprings in the changeover operation within the apra.    the other elective positions were filled with apra members who do not follow garcia's line. thus, the presence of alan garcia within the party was reduced to being member of the political commission in his capacity as former party secretary general.    two days ago, the peruvian chief of state resigned the apra presidency, upset over criticism directed at him during the opening of the party congress. he thus responded to obvious signs that the party president post would be eliminated.    the apra had thought alan garcia would be a very capable heir to victor raul haya de la torre, the party's founder and historical leader, who died in 1979. three and one-half years after garcia's election victory, the party disqualified garcia for the role of haya de la torre's successor because of his errors and his failure to rectify his government line.    following the tradition initiated by alan garcia, new apra leader luis alva castro will be sworn in as secretary general this coming friday before the tomb of haya de la torre in the northern city of trujillo, the

with killings averaging four per day.    an internal political storm hit the apra 16th national congress, and vice president sanchez said that he cannot recall anything similar.    during the last
